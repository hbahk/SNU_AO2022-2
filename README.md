# SNU Astronomical Observation II

This repo includes a pedagogical example about spectroscopic data reduction process. This course is for undergraduate students at SNU, thus note that example presented here often skips some details that needed for a careful research.

The main notebook containing the process of the spectroscopic data reduction is originally written by **Jooyeon Geem**, and later edited by **Hyeonguk Bahk**; myself.
I believe she made her notebook based on the tutorials made with *astonishing* effort by **Yoonsoo P. Bach** ([SNU_AOclass repo](https://github.com/ysBach/SNU_AOclass/tree/master/Notebooks))

This repo might be converted to private at the end of this semester.
