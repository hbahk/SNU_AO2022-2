# SNU Astronomical Observation II

Here is a notebook containing the main contents: [Spectroscopic Data Reduction](https://nbviewer.org/github/hbahk/SNU_AO22-2/blob/main/Spectroscopic-Data-Reduction.ipynb)

This repo includes a pedagogical example about spectroscopic data reduction process. This course is for undergraduate students at SNU, thus note that example presented here often skips some details that needed for a careful research.

The main notebook containing the process of the spectroscopic data reduction is originally written by **Jooyeon Geem**, and later edited by **Hyeonguk Bahk**; myself.
I believe she made her notebook based on the tutorials made with *astonishing* effort by **Yoonsoo P. Bach** ([SNU_AOclass repo](https://github.com/ysBach/SNU_AOclass/tree/master/Notebooks))

This repo might be converted to private at the end of this semester.
If you are undergoing problems and issues regarding this repo, please feel free to report them by opening issues here.
